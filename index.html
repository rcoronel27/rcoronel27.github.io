    <h2>Artifacts</h2>

    <div class="artifact">
        <iframe src="2024 The FIRE Summit - Silver Lining Formatted.pdf" width="100%" height="400px" style="border:1px solid #ccc;"></iframe>
        <p>This is a research poster completed in December 2024, a culmination of my work in the First-Year Innovation & Research Experience (FIRE).
            I worked with a group of three others and a faculty advisor to analyze if the opening
             of the DC Metro Silver Line affected nearby housing prices.

    <div class="artifact">
        <iframe src="AAST250 Coronel Critical Analysis.pdf" width="100%" height="400px" style="border:1px solid #ccc;"></iframe>
        <p>This artifact is a critical analysis completed in March 2025 of 1970s Gourmet magazine where I compared its portrayal of Singapore as a colonial vacation spot
             against a modern food documentary that highlighted the Peranakan culture of the Singaporean people.

    <div class="artifact">
        <iframe src="ENGL393 white paper.pdf" width="100%" height="400px" style="border:1px solid #ccc;"></iframe>
        <p>This artifact is a white paper I completed in May 2025. I took care to create a visually appealing yet research-based document to convince 
            readers to attend a Talk Story event hosted by the 1882 Foundation.

        <p>This artifact is a Photoshop project completed in April 2025 where I emphasized the concept of an information detox we learned in class, and I drew inspiration from two other posters.

    <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
    <p>As an information science major, I want to use my skills in data analysis to create good in the world. 
        In fact, I switched my major from computer science to information science because I worried I wasn't developing the skills I wished. 
        In addition, as an Asian American studies minor, I have a fervent interest in the preservation of Asian American culture and history, 
        and I am a firm advocate for diversity in any team, workplace, or situation I find myself in.
