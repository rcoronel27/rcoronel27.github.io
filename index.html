            <p>
                Hello! My name is Raphael Coronel, and I am an information science major and Asian American studies minor studying at the University of Maryland, College Park. I have created this portfolio to show my skills in composition, research, and writing. I have selected some class projects and assignments that I believe best represent my abilities and will frequently update as my finished work evolves.

    <h2>Artifacts</h2>

    <div class="artifact">
        <iframe src="2024 The FIRE Summit - Silver Lining Formatted.pdf" width="100%" height="400px" style="border:1px solid #ccc;"></iframe>
        <p> <b><i>Jan 2024 - Dec 2024</i></b> | This is a research poster, a culmination of my work in the First-Year Innovation & Research Experience (FIRE).
            I worked with a group of three fellow students and a faculty advisor to analyze how the opening
             of the DC Metro Silver Line affected nearby housing prices.

    <div class="artifact">
        <iframe src="AAST250 Coronel Critical Analysis.pdf" width="100%" height="400px" style="border:1px solid #ccc;"></iframe>
        <p><b><i>Mar 2025</i></b> | This artifact is a critical analysis of 1970s Gourmet magazine where I compared its portrayal of Singapore as a colonial vacation spot
             against a modern food documentary that highlighted the Peranakan culture of the Singaporean people.

    <div class="artifact">
        <iframe src="ENGL393 white paper.pdf" width="100%" height="400px" style="border:1px solid #ccc;"></iframe>
        <p><b><i>Apr 2025 - May 2025</i></b> | This artifact is a white paper. I took care to create a visually appealing yet research-based document to convince 
            readers to attend and join Talk Story events hosted by the 1882 Foundation.

        <img id="amstposter" src="amst-poster-2 (1) (1).jpg">
        <p><b><i>Apr 2025</i></b> | This artifact is a Photoshop project where I emphasized the concept of an information detox we learned in class, and I carefully interwove two existing posters to create something visually striking, even from a distance.

    <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;As an information science major, I want to use my skills in data analysis to create good in the world. I started as a computer science major, but I felt unfulfilled by seemingly vacuous coding. My decision to switch from computer science to information science wasn’t easy, but it was necessary. I realized I was more interested in the impact of data than the abstract mechanics behind it. Information science offered the bridge I needed between technology and people. I hope to continue learning the ways how information affects people and how to convey it in accessible ways to users and my future coworkers.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;In addition, as an Asian American studies minor, I know full well the need to preserve Asian American culture and history in our ever-changing society, and I am a firm advocate for diversity in any team, workplace, or situation I find myself in. Both my coursework in Asian American studies and my involvement in the Filipino Cultural Association inform how I approach data ethics and representation, ensuring that historically underrepresented people remain seen and respected. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;As an incoming vice president of Ganji, UMD’s K-Pop dance club, I prioritize clear communication and adherence to group schedules to keep club operations running seamlessly. I’ve learned how to organize the logistics to support my fellow board members’ creative visions, and I’ve spent countless hours learning choreographies and tirelessly fixing details to make our performances shine. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;In the future, I hope to work at the intersection of technology and public service, helping institutions better understand and serve diverse communities through curated data use. I believe that well-rounded thinking is essential to create the tools needed to keep our world running, not just smoothly, but fairly and equitably.
